# OpenFeather
In bird feathers, the individual side branches (barbs) are connected to each other by a hook-and-eye system similar to Velcro. 
To explain this principle to school children, no commercial models exist that show this mechanism in a simplified way. 
In this repository are the stl files of such a model, which can be printed by a commercial FDM-3D printer. However, a flexible material must be used.
